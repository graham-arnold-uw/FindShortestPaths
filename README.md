Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm CSE 373: Data Structure and Algorithms

FindPaths.java uses two input files, one with a list of vertices,
and one with a list of edges and weights and constructs a graph data structure.

An interactive user session begins allowing the user to 
input the identifiers for two nodes and the program will print the shortest path.
